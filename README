This is a fork of dbmaintain (http://www.dbmaintain.org/overview.html) with some custom features and bug fixes:
- https://unitils.atlassian.net/browse/DBM-100
- https://unitils.atlassian.net/browse/DBM-101
- https://unitils.atlassian.net/browse/DBM-122
- https://unitils.atlassian.net/browse/DBM-123

It's neither supported by the dbmaintain team nor by me, but feel free to use it. If you find the features/fixes useful then I'd ask you to vote for the JIRA tickets, so that they might be implemented in future versions of DBMaintain.
